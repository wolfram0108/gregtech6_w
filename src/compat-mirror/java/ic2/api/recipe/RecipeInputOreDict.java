 * COMPILE-TIME STAND-IN — NOT THIRD-PARTY CODE.
 *
 * This declaration was written from scratch for the GregTech 6 NeoForge port
 * (https://github.com/wolfram0108/gregtech6_w). It contains no code from the project
 * that owns this package name, and no part of it was copied or decompiled from that
 * project: it declares only the members GregTech 6 itself implements or calls, so that
 * the port compiles while integration with that mod stays deferred.
 *
 * The original package name is kept deliberately, because GregTech 6 implements these
 * types verbatim and the port does not alter the code Gregorius Techneticies wrote.
 * Removing these classes from the build is not possible: 66 classes of the mod extend
 * or implement them, and the JVM requires the type to load the implementing class.
 *
 * All names, trademarks and rights in the project this package belongs to remain with
 * its authors. See src/compat-mirror/README.md and NOTICE.
